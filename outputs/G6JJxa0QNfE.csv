"Awesome, thank you very much for the video"
"I accidentely pressed the Rainbow Off button, and now I cant get it to work anymore on one of my csv files.. any way to fix this? reinstalling worked for some files, but not all files have the column identifer feature, colors show but not that, also the buttons are gone at the bottom"
But is cool
Not working well with &quot;;&quot; separator nor with tab separator.
Write a Python function named genreate_sha256 that generates all possible 7-digit pin and the corresponding sha256 hash values and saves it into a file named ‘rainbow.csv’.  <br><br>Anyone else on this question?
Nice!
